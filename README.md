# Book-Search-MERN
    This application is a full stack app with MERN to search the Google Books API by Title. Then allows user to view the book, add to saved list, and delete books from saved list.


## Bugs
    * Program not saving books when run locally. 
    * Delete button not working, but can't test because it will not work locally

## Future Improvements
    * Some styling quirks that should be fixed.
