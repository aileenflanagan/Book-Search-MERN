# Book-Search-MERN
    This application is a full stack app with MERN to search the Google Books API by Title. Then allows user to view the book, add to saved list, and delete books from saved list.


## Bugs
    * Save button is not working properly due to issue with routes.
    * Books will not load also due to issues with routes.

## Future Improvements
    * Some styling quirks that should be fixed.
